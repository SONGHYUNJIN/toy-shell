# toy-shell
I am using Windows 10 so I install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
I understand how to upload the file to Github using Ubuntu but i dont know how to get the file from Github and compile it..
I implemented the exit function in toy-shell program.
If you input exit, it returns to the initial command terminal.
It's too difficult because I haven't fully understand the assignment.
